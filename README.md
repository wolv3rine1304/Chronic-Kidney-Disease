# Chronic Kidney Disease 

## Introduction
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a widespread health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a progressive loss of kidney function over time, and if left untreated, it can lead to complete kidney failure. Early diagnosis and intervention can slow the progression of the disease and prevent complications.

This repository contains a machine learning model that can predict the presence of CKD using patient data. The model is built using Python and several popular machine learning libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train and test the model is the Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset, which can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 400 records with 24 attributes such as age, blood pressure, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin. Each record represents a patient, and the target variable is a binary indicator of the presence of CKD.
